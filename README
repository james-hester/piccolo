Piccolo
-------

Piccolo is a programming language for 8-bit PIC microcontrollers.
Unlike C, it is designed specifically for the PIC and requires no runtime;
it could be considered a "high level assembly."
Piccolo is meant to be more approachable than PIC assembly in several ways:
1. Its orthogonal, Python-like syntax.
2. Its simple compilation model; Piccolo is strictly a tool for "programming in the small" and will never support a linker, multi-file projects, etc. As Wirth wrote in "The Language PICL and its Implementation":

> Programs for computers with 64 bytes of data and 2K of program storage are inherently short; their descriptions should therefore not be longwinded.

3. Its tooling, providing
3a. IDE niceties such as go-to-definition and
3b. more advanced error checking than pic-as.
