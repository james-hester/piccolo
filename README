Piccolo
-------

Piccolo is a programming language for 8-bit PIC microcontrollers.
Unlike C, it is designed specifically for the PIC and requires no runtime;
it could be considered a "high level assembly."
Piccolo is meant to be more approachable than PIC assembly in several ways:
1. Its orthogonal, Python-like syntax.
2. Its simple compilation model; Piccolo is strictly a tool for "programming in the small" and will never support a linker, multi-file projects, etc. As Wirth wrote in "The Language PICL and its Implementation":

> Programs for computers with 64 bytes of data and 2K of program storage are inherently short; their descriptions should therefore not be longwinded.

3. Its tooling, providing
3a. IDE niceties such as go-to-definition and
3b. more advanced error checking than pic-as.

Piccolo features an approach to memory inspired by IBM's Commercial Translator (COMTRAN), a predecessor of COBOL designed in the 1950s for business data processing on IBM 1401 mainframes.
COMTRAN, like assembly language, didn't have any provisions for "automatic variables"; all names identified fixed memory locations.
Despite this, COMTRAN provided a remarkably high level programming experience,
featuring a hierarchy for data fields and a set of features for describing
data that provide something like compound data types.

Setup
-----

go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer@latest


Scope
-----

This example Piccolo program shows every feature Piccolo currently implements.
Piccolo will compile this program into a .hex file that can be flashed to a PIC16F1776 microcontroller.

```
fn function-name() begin -- function definition, comments
  w = 5 -- MOVLW, decimal literal
  return -- RETURN
end
```
