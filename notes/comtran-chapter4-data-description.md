# Chapter 4: Data Description

## What a Data Description Is

The preceding chapter has shown how to write instructions that direct the computer to perform various kinds of operations. Up to this point, the discussion has been limited to operations that act directly on the actual data of the problem being solved. It has been assumed that the various items of data had already been placed in the system for this purpose.

In actual practice, however, the programmer must make the arrangements for placing the data into the system in a manner which permits it to be used efficiently. Although this is not difficult, it requires thoughtful planning. It assumes that the data is arranged according to a well defined plan, and it consists of furnishing the system with information about that plan. If the data is not suitably organized, the programmer must work out an appropriate plan and arrange the data accordingly. The principles involved are not unlike those the programmer would follow if he were designing a set of business forms for handling the data manually.

The need for doing this should quickly become apparent. Suppose, for example, that a clerk has jotted down on a scrap of paper the figures "46.30." These figures presumably represent a value that means something to him. But could anyone else tell what kind of a value this is? Is it, for example, a unit selling price? The number of hours worked by an employee? A discount? The percentage of water in a chemical product? Obviously, the number, standing alone, has very little practical significance.

In normal business operations, of course, there are several means of identifying values of this kind. In some cases the number will actually be labeled. In many other cases its identity will be seen at once from the fact that it appears in a particular position on a particular form, or that it is written in a certain column in a certain ledger.

When data is entered into a data processing system, it is rarely feasible to label each number. If "46.30" is a rate of pay, for example, the programmer would not write "$46.30 per 40-hour week." Neither would he write "46.30 lbs. per cu. ft." if it were a measure of weight. The value would be entered simply as a number, and the programmer would have to find some other way to show what the number represented. The method of doing this is explained in this chapter.

### The Purpose of a Data Description

It can be said, therefore, that a major purpose of writing a "data description" is to furnish the processing system with a means of identifying each item of data which has been named in the procedure statements. This description must include all items on which the system is to operate.

Actually, the system needs more than a means of merely identifying the data. If the data is numeric, for instance, there must be a means of showing where the decimal point is located. If the system is to print out monetary values, it must have information on where to place the dollar sign, and whether or not to print leading zeros. Details of this sort are usually referred to as "editing." Some of them are handled automatically by the processor, so that the programmer need not concern himself with them. In other cases, the programmer can specify one of several methods for handling a particular situation; in such a case, the data description allows him to give the required instructions.

Writing a data description is not difficult, once a few basic principles are understood, and these are explained in the following pages. The reader should realize, moreover, that this method of describing data in a separate section of the program has a number of important advantages.

In the first place, the typical program will deal repeatedly with data of the same kind. Use of a separate data description permits the programmer to describe each kind of data once, instead of having to describe each individual item as it occurs.

A second consideration is that, once a given set of data has been described, the same description can be used again as part of a new program that works with the same data, or the same kinds of data. This would be a considerable advantage even if it were necessary to copy the data description into the new program by punching new cards. In practice, however, the data description can actually be stored in the library, on tape or in cards, so that it can be called for when needed.

Finally, the Commercial Translator data description is so designed that a program developed for use on one data processing system can be run on a different kind of system (within limits) with relatively few changes in the data description. A basic reason why this is possible is that the data description is tailored to the logical structure of the data files, which do not alter materially from machine to machine, while most of the details that relate to actual equipment are handled by the processors furnished for the various machine systems. The programmer is thus spared many of the problems that can arise when it is necessary to run a program on a system other than the one for which it was originally designed.

A data description for a data processing system contains a number of elements which are already familiar to those who have worked with punched card equipment. As most readers will recognize at once, punched card operations require that data be arranged in the cards in accordance with a definite pattern. In essence, each item of data is identified by its physical position in the card. Thus, if the first six columns of a deck of payroll cards are reserved for employee numbers, the system will treat all values in those columns as employee numbers, unless special coding is used to indicate exceptions. But any such exceptions must be indicated by codes which are themselves identifiable by their positions in the card. In short, the key to identifying a value in a punched card is its position in the card.

The same basic rule applies to electronic systems, but the number of possible positions is greatly increased. Moreover, data can be shifted from one position to another. Yet it is always the position of the data that identifies it, and it is one of the functions of a Commercial Translator processor to keep track of the position of each item.

For this reason, a major part of a data description consists of the details necessary to determine the position of each item. Among other things, it is necessary to give the length of each kind of item (that is, the space it will require) and its relative position in the file. The processor will use this information to assign an initial location in storage for each kind of data. At the same time, it will note the name which the programmer has assigned to the item. By relating this name to the location, the program will be able to find the item when it is referred to by name. Furthermore, it will keep track of all changes in the position of the item; this saves the programmer from having to deal with internal addresses in the system and permits him to refer to data by name.

It follows, of course, that the efficiency of the program will depend in part on the arrangement of the data. The data description provides for describing a data organization already in existence. If the arrangement of the data does not take full advantage of the capacities of the system, the programmer may wish to reorganize the original input data before writing the data description.

## Files, Records, and Fields

Before proceeding with the details of the data description it is only necessary to define three terms as they are used in the Commercial Translator system: "file," "record," and "field." The exact implication of these terms varies from person to person and company to company. In this manual they are used to distinguish between kinds of data that can be operated on by different Commercial Translator instructions. Thus, the verbs OPEN and CLOSE can operate only on files, and a file must therefore be regarded as a body of data organized for use within the scope of those commands. Similarly, the verbs GET and FILE can operate only on records, so that a record can be defined as a body of data which can be governed by those commands. Fields, on the other hand, are subordinate units of data and are not readily definable in terms of the commands that affect them. While these definitions may seem somewhat arbitrary, it will be found that in practice they correlate with normal principles of data organization.

### Files

A *file* is a body of data stored in some external medium which can be made accessible to the system by the use of the verb OPEN. In this sense, an external medium is any medium which provides input to the system from without. Data in such a medium cannot be used by the system until it has been brought into it, which is the basic purpose of an OPEN command. The usual external medium of electronic data processing systems, of course, is magnetic tape.

The concept of a file as "external" to the system carries certain implications which should be considered. These arise, not from the definition of a file, but rather from certain practical considerations.

For example, a file is usually a relatively large body of data, although there is no implied relationship between the length of a file and the storage capacity of a tape. Thus, there may be more than one file on a tape, and, on the other hand, a file may extend over a number of tapes.

A file is commonly understood to consist of a number of individual records, the records being generally similar to each other in size, content, and format. (Sometimes a series of differing records may be grouped together in a file; in such a case, the programmer must make provisions for distinguishing among them.) The file itself may be unique, or it may closely resemble other files. Thus, a file of actuarial data might be the only one of its kind in a library, while a file of insurance policy data might differ from another chiefly because it covers a different area or a different period of time. In this sense, a file serves a function like that of a ledger, or a filing cabinet containing a series of similar papers. It is usually a rather large body of related information. Thus it is convenient in most cases to treat such large bodies of data as complete and separate units which can be identified externally by direct reference to the physical media in which they are stored. Such media may be controlled only by the OPEN and CLOSE instructions, and this fact accounts for the definition of a file used in the Commercial Translator system.

Many files contain special records which are used primarily to identify the file and its contents. These records are called "labels." If labels are used, one is normally placed at the beginning of the file, and another is placed at the end. These labels correspond in many ways to the labels on file drawers, except that certain technical information is required because of the nature of an electronic system. Many of the details of labeling are handled automatically by the "input-output package" provided for each system. Most labeling procedures are prescribed in the environment description for each machine system, and will be discussed, therefore, in the publication covering the Commercial Translator processor for each particular system. However, the programmer has the option of prescribing certain details of a label by the use of the LABEL type code, which is discussed later in this chapter.

### Records

A *record* is a portion of a file which can be made accessible to the system by the verb GET, assuming the file has previously been "opened." The size and position of a record in storage are determined by the specifications given in the data description. Its contents are referred to by their location in storage, whereas a file, as such, is never actually brought into storage. In other words, a record, unlike a file, is conceived as an "internal" body of data, even though it may be stored externally for long periods of time as part of a file.

Usually, but not necessarily, the records within a file are similar to each other in content, size, and format. For example, there might be a file called PAYROLL RECORD—EASTERN REGION, which would contain hundreds, or thousands, of individual payroll records. Each individual record would normally contain data relating to a particular employee, such as his name, employee number, job title or class, pay rate, dependency classification, deductions, and so on. The separate parts of a record might be quite dissimilar, but they would all relate to a single subject (in this case, an employee), and other records in the same file would carry similar information about other employees. Furthermore, each item would occupy the same relative position in one record that it does in another; it would also have the same format and be of the same size. This makes it possible to describe each *kind* of data instead of each individual item of data.

A record may be obtained for use by the verb GET, and, when processing has been completed, it may be placed in an output file by the verb FILE.

### Fields

A *field* is a block of data which can be operated on as a unit by the arithmetic commands and by the commands that control the movement of data within the system (other than the verbs GET and FILE). In many cases, a field will be a subordinate part of a record (such as a PAY.RATE field within a record called PAY.RECORD). However, this relationship does not necessarily hold. A record may contain only one field, for example, and, in fact, several records, or parts of several different records, may be regrouped within storage to form a new block of data which can then be treated as a field. Fields must always be defined in the data description.

In most cases, a field is considered to deal with only one element of data, at least for the purposes of the operation being performed. In a payroll record, for instance, such items of data as employee name, pay rate, employee number, and so on, would each be treated as a field. In practice, a field may be further subdivided. The classic example is the representation of a date. According to one view, the complete date, consisting of day, month, and year, is a single field, and the smaller components are regarded as "subfields." Another view holds that day, month, and year are each fields, and that the complete date is a group of fields.

As far as the Commercial Translator language is concerned, however, distinctions between subfields, fields, and groups of fields are handled by assigning "level" numbers to the various components. This is explained later in this chapter. It is felt that this method eliminates confusion that could result from trying to show relationships among the smaller units of data by the use of only three terms (i.e., field, subfield, and group of fields), and it allows, through the use of level numbers, a greater degree of flexibility in organizing the data. In general, it should be understood that a field is any element of data which can be operated upon by arithmetic and/or data transmission verbs.

## Data Description Format

The detailed information which must be supplied in order to describe the data fully can be entered into the system easily by the use of punched cards. A separate card is used for each kind of data item. The format of the card is reflected in the data description form, which is illustrated in Figure 1.

The spaces on this form correspond exactly to the columns of the cards, so that the information written on each line of the form can be punched directly in a card without editing. Since the form provides a field for each of the various kinds of information required, it will serve in this chapter as a convenient check-off list by which to list and discuss each of the items required in the data description.

A "division header" must be placed immediately before the first entry of each consecutive group of data description cards. The name \*DATA, placed so that the asterisk is in Column 7, should be the only entry on the line (i.e., card), except for the serial number and identification entries in Columns 1-6 and 73-80.

### General

As will be seen from the illustration, the form provides spaces for each column in the card. The spaces representing Columns 1 through 3 and 73 through 80 are shown only once, since the information they will contain is assumed to be repeated for each line of the form. The information to be written in Columns 4 through 72, however, will vary from card to card, and spaces corresponding to these columns are therefore provided on each line.

The programmer should follow these space marks exactly, so that each item of information will be punched in the columns reserved for it. It will be noted that the data description format differs from the procedure description format in several ways. In particular, the former is more rigid; it does not allow "free form" description.

The columnar format of the card is summarized in the following table:

| Columns | Number of Columns | Use |
|---------|-------------------|-----|
| 1-6 | 6 | Card Serial Number |
| 7-22 | 16 | Name |
| 23-24 | 2 | Level Indication |
| 25-30 | 6 | Type |
| 31-35 | 5 | Quantity |
| 36 | 1 | Mode |
| 37 | 1 | Justification |
| 38-71 | 34 | Description |
| 72 | 1 | Continuation Indication |
| 73-80 | 8 | Identification |

### Ctl. and Serial (Col. 1-6)

It is essential that each item of the data description be entered into the system in proper sequence, since the sequence controls the internal position of the data. The first six columns are reserved for a serial number, which is used to indicate the sequence of the cards. This number is normally numeric. Its first three digits are written in the box marked "CTL" (for "control"), which corresponds to Columns 1 through 3. It is assumed that the first three digits will be common to all serial numbers written on the same page. Although these digits must be punched in each card, it is sufficient to write them once in the CTL box, instead of repeating them on each line. The remaining digits are written in the box labeled "SERIAL," which corresponds to Columns 4 through 6. In normal practice, only Columns 4 and 5 are used initially, and Column 6 is left blank. This makes it possible to insert correction cards later if necessary. The blank is the first character in the collating sequence and will therefore be placed in sequence before any other character in the same column. Thus, if the numbers 23 and 24 have been punched in Columns 4 and 5, each will be read as a three-digit number with a blank in the third position, and a correction card with the number 235 would be collated between them.

When the cards are read into the data processing system, their serial numbers will be checked for correctness of sequence. In all IBM machines the numeric collating sequence is, first, the blank, then the numerals from 0 to 9. Alphabetic characters, if any, will be checked for sequence in accordance with the collating sequence of the particular machine system.

### Data Name (Col. 7-22)

Columns 7 through 22 are reserved for any name which the programmer may have assigned to the data described in the card. The rules for forming names (see page 15) state that a name may contain as many as 30 characters. The card format provides only 16 columns, however, so that any name having more than 16 characters must be carried over to the "Data Name" columns in a succeeding line. In order for the processor to recognize this situation, the programmer must place a character in the continuation indication column (Column 72). Any non-blank character will serve the purpose. The processor will then be able to combine the two parts of the name into a single name. The programmer need not worry about the point at which the break between lines occurs; the processor will close up any blanks occurring in the "Data Name" columns. This provision allows the programmer to indent the carryover if he wishes.

Names are usually written with an assumed left margin immediately to the left of Column 7. They may be indented from this assumed margin if the programmer wishes, but the processor will ignore any indentation. If no name is assigned, Columns 7 through 22 should be left blank.

Names may be assigned to any item of data, or to any group of data items stored consecutively within the system. Thus, names may be given not only to groups of items in the input files, but also to groups formed within storage as a result of operations performed by the system. Any name so assigned may be used as an operand in a procedure statement.

All data-names used in the program must be defined in the data description. In actual operation, the system will convert these names to actual machine addresses when the object program is assembled and will use those addresses as the actual means of locating the data. The purpose of writing the names in the data description is to furnish the processor with the information it needs to do this.

Data-names must not overlap. Each field within a record can be given a name, and any group of consecutive fields can also be given a name. Thus, a single field may be operated on individually by reference to its name, or collectively as part of a group called by the group name. However, the same field may not be included as a part of each of two overlapping named groups of fields.

For example, if three successive fields are named A, B, and C, the group name X might be assigned to the pair A and B. If this were done, the name Y could *not* be assigned to the pair B and C, since field B is already part of a named group of fields. If the programmer needs to be able to refer to fields B and C by a single name, however, he can rename the entire group of three fields, using the REDEF type code described later in this chapter. This procedure would not delete the original names; the new names and the names originally assigned would all be available for use thereafter.

### Level (Col. 23-24)

Level numbers are used to describe the way in which a body of data is organized. Basically, level numbers are assigned to items of data to show their relationship to other items of data—or, in other words, to show the structure of a record. Any number from 1 to 99 can be used. All data description entries must be assigned level numbers.

In general, each item is considered to be a subdivision of the last item preceding it which has a lower number. Figure 2 shows how a typical series of files, records, and fields might be organized, using the familiar method called outlining. The file structure is shown by the use of indentation, each item being considered a part of the last item above it which is indented to a lesser degree.

The technique of indentation, in other words, is a visual way of showing level. It may be used in the "Data Name" columns, but it will have no effect on the processor itself. However, since it helps to identify the various levels visually, indentation may be useful in clarifying the file structure when the program is listed.

For comparison, two additional columns have been provided at the right in Figure 2. These show the data classification of each item, together with hypothetical level numbers such as might be assigned to a file structure of this kind. It should be pointed out that entries for files and groups of files are not actually used in the data description.

It is obvious from the outline that each item from EMPLOYEE NUMBER through LOCATION is a part of PAY RECORD, and that each item from FICA through HOSPITALIZATION is a part of DEDUCTIONS, YEAR TO DATE. Had the principle of indentation not been used, the reader might still determine these relationships by examining the level numbers in the right hand column, following the rule that each item is part of the next item above with a lower number. The processor, of course, will ignore any indentation and will store the data in accordance with the level numbers.

It is not necessary that level numbers be assigned in consecutive order, although it is done that way in Figure 2. The items at level 02, for example, might have been assigned level 04, or any other convenient number, as long as it was greater than 01. Similarly, the items at level 03 could have been given any other number as long as it was greater than the number of the next higher classification. In fact, it is often useful to skip numbers when they are initially assigned, to allow for possible regroupings or insertions at a later time.

The reader will also note that each item at the record level and below represents a *kind* of data, not a specific item of information. Thus, although there will be only one file called EASTERN REGION SALES FORCE, within that file there will be many individual units called PAY RECORD, and each of these will contain information of the same general character and format, as specified by the names of the fields within it. The purpose of the data description is to give information about each of these *kinds* of data. The data description should be thought of as a "pattern" which the files will follow.

It may be helpful to consider a second method of showing how data may be organized. Figure 3 shows how the same payroll file might be represented in the form of an organization chart.

This chart demonstrates one important fact: Each item of data is, or may be, related to other items above and below it. In other words, the data is organized "vertically"—no item is related directly to any other item at the same level, except through an item at a higher level. One result of this is that if a particular item is of the same kind as other items in the file, it may be identified by reference to the item above it in the organization structure. Thus, the name PAY RECORD does not single out any one unique kind of item, but SALES FORCE PAY RECORD distinguishes one kind of item from any item designated PRODUCTION FORCE PAY RECORD. Similarly, since in this illustration there are two SALES FORCE files, each can be identified by reference to the next higher level. Thus, a particular kind of item might be known as EASTERN REGION SALES FORCE PAY RECORD.

The use of a higher name to identify a lower one is known as "name qualification," and a name so qualified is known as a "compound name." This is an important method of identifying individual items which do not have names unique in the program. It is true that in this illustration the qualifying names are those of files. However, the principle is applicable internally, within files, whenever it is necessary to distinguish between fields having the same name. (See the discussion of compound names beginning on page 15.)

Level numbers are not actually attached to the data in the sense that an employee number is part of a pay record. They are used to instruct the processor to perform certain technical functions which need not concern the programmer. Essentially, they are used before the actual data is read into the system, as a means of preparing the system to receive it. Once the data description has been written, the programmer need no longer concern himself with level numbers unless, owing to changes in the data or the program, a new data description should become necessary.

### Type (Col. 25-30)

Columns 25 through 30 are used, when necessary, to show that the data being described is of a certain special type. If these columns are left blank, it will be assumed that the remainder of the particular entry describes a data field or group of fields. The type codes which may be used in these columns are the following:

- RECORD
- COND
- FUNCT
- PARAM
- REDEF
- COPY
- LABEL

Each of these is discussed in the following pages.

#### RECORD

This type code shows that the data being described is a record and is therefore accessible by GET and FILE instructions. This is equivalent to identifying an item of data as an input/output record. Each record named in the data description must also be named in the environment description, as specified in the publication covering the processor for each particular system.

#### COND

The type code COND is used to show that the data referred to is one of the possible conditions which a conditional variable may assume. In the discussion of conditional expressions in Chapter 2, it was pointed out that a conditional variable is the name of a field which will contain, at different times, any of a number of different values, depending on conditions existing in the data. Each of the values that may be placed in the field is a "condition."

In an example used in Chapter 2, the name MARITAL.STATUS was given as the name of a conditional variable. This name refers to a specific field reserved in storage into which values representing conditions will be entered. Typical conditions for this field would be "single," "married," and "divorced." While these words could actually be placed in the MARITAL.STATUS field, it is more economical of space, and generally more efficient, to use codes. The initial letters M, S, and D were used as codes in this example. Thus, the field MARITAL.STATUS might contain any one of these letters at a given time.

However, so that the programmer can refer to these codes by their names, he must specify in the data description which code corresponds to each name. This may be done in the following manner:

Suppose that the field MARITAL.STATUS has been given the level number 06. The names of the conditions which may be entered into the field must then be assigned a lower level (i.e., a higher number) and entered in the data description immediately following the name of the field. This means that they will be treated as if they were each a subdivision of the field, in accordance with the rules for assigning level numbers, although, in practice, only one condition will be considered at a time. A portion of the data description might then appear as follows:

| SERIAL | DATA NAME | LEVEL | TYPE | DESCRIPTION |
|--------|-----------|-------|------|-------------|
| | MARITAL.STATUS | 06 | | A |
| | SINGLE | 07 | COND | 'S' |
| | MARRIED | 07 | COND | 'M' |
| | DIVORCED | 07 | COND | 'D' |

The entries under "Description" will be explained later in this chapter, but, in summary, the "A" indicates that the field will contain one non-numeric character, while the initials S, M, and D are enclosed in quotation marks to show that they are the actual values to be used in the program.

In this example, the fact that the names SINGLE, MARRIED, and DIVORCED are the names of conditions is shown by the use of the type code COND. The relationship of these conditions to the field MARITAL.STATUS is shown by the fact that the condition-names have a higher level number and follow the name of the conditional variable immediately.

It should always be remembered that the condition-name is the name of the *value* which can be placed in a field; it is not the name of the field itself. As was pointed out in Chapter 2, the condition-name MARRIED, in this case, would be equivalent to MARITAL.STATUS='M'; it follows that such expressions as SET MARRIED or IF MARRIED will be interpreted to mean SET MARITAL.STATUS='M' and IF MARITAL.STATUS='M' respectively. The condition-name, in other words, is a short way of writing an expression that shows the value in the field.

It is not always necessary to list condition-names in the data description in the manner shown above. If the programmer, when he writes the source program, limits himself to the full form of conditional expressions (such as IF MARITAL.STATUS = 'M' THEN...), he need not assign names to the conditions. However, if he wishes to use the shorter and more convenient method of referring to conditions by name, he must write a data description entry for each.

#### FUNCT

A function has been defined in Chapter 2 as a result obtained by following a procedure. In the Commercial Translator system, the term is used only in connection with procedures specified in the BEGIN SECTION command. Any data-name specified in the GIVING clause of the BEGIN SECTION command is a function in this sense, and it must be identified as such in the data description. The function-name is identified by the type code FUNCT, and the function must be fully described in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The parameters written in the USING clause of the BEGIN SECTION command must be identified in the data description by the type code PARAM, as explained immediately below. (See the discussion of functions in Chapter 2 and the BEGIN SECTION command in Chapter 3.)

#### PARAM

The type code PARAM is an abbreviation of the term "parameter." It is required, if appropriate, to show that the item of data being described is a parameter for use in a routine used to obtain a function. (See the discussion of functions in Chapter 2, the command BEGIN SECTION in Chapter 3, and the type code FUNCT above.)

Specifically, when the program contains a section introduced by a BEGIN SECTION command, each data-name listed in the USING clause of that command is a parameter, and it must be described as such in the data description.

#### REDEF

The code REDEF is used whenever it is necessary to redefine an area or an item of data that has previously been defined in some other way. This is usually necessary whenever a portion of the program "overlaps" another—i.e., when it calls for the use, on a "time-sharing" basis, of data or storage space which has previously been defined for some other purpose. It is also used in setting up tables in the system.

For example, it may be necessary to call existing data by a new set of names, or to reorganize it by altering the groupings and/or the subordinate level numbers. Frequently it is necessary to wipe out data to make room for other data. In any such case, a new data description is required for the new items or the new names. However, the name or names of the areas being redefined must first be listed, using the type code REDEF to show that the accompanying data description may also be used to refer to the same area. The REDEF entry must have the same level number as the entry being redefined. An illustration will be found later in this section, in the discussion of tables, on page 75.

Use of the REDEF code does not erase data in storage, unless an attempt is made to place two or more different constants in the same area; however, it does superimpose a new format upon the data already present. If the programmer wishes to change an item in storage, such as a value in a table, he may do so by using a MOVE instruction that specifies the new data and the position in storage where it is to be placed.

Redefinition does not cancel the previous definition. It merely makes it possible to refer to the same area by different names and for different uses. Once an area has been defined, all names associated with the definition may be used at any time, regardless of subsequent redefinitions.

##### Tables

A valuable function of the REDEF code is to make it possible to set up tables in storage and to define the methods of locating individual items in the tables. The following example shows a method of doing this:

Suppose the programmer wishes to place in memory the table described in Chapter 2 (see page 29), which shows passenger transportation rates to each of 30 different cities. Each line in this table lists a city, a one-way rate, a round trip rate, and an excursion rate. If it were printed in a book of rate schedules, it would probably contain four columns, headed "City," "One-Way," "Round Trip," and "Excursion." A portion of this table might have the following form:

| City | One-Way | Round Trip | Excursion |
|------|---------|------------|-----------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Los Angeles | 153.42 | 285.16 | 212.87 |
| Miami | 78.60 | 141.63 | 118.92 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

To place such a table into a Commercial Translator program, the programmer must first analyze it to determine the maximum size of each kind of item. He may find, for example, that 14 character spaces will be required for the longest name in the "City" list, and that each of the rate listings can be accommodated if space for five digits is reserved for each rate value.

The actual data may then be entered by copying all of the individual items in sequence, reading across each line and allowing blank spaces (or zeros) as filler in those items that occupy less than the allowed space. Thus the initial data entry might read, in part:

| SERIAL | DATA NAME | LEVEL | DESCRIPTION |
|--------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| | RATE.TABLE | 01 | |
| | | 02 | 'LOS ANGELES  153422851621287' |
| | | 02 | 'MIAMI         078601416311892' |

The entries at the 02 level, which could extend over as many lines as necessary to accommodate all of the data, specify a series of constants. These are enclosed in quotation marks in accordance with the rules for writing constants. Note that decimal points are not normally required in constants of this kind, since the location of the decimal point will be specified in a later entry.

The result of this entry is twofold: Space is reserved in memory for the entire table, and the individual items are stored in a sequence which permits them to be located after the table has been more fully described. At this point, however, no means of identifying any single item of data has yet been established. This must be accomplished by superimposing the format and structure of the table on the data already placed in storage. It is done by redefining the format of the data, using a series of entries such as the following:

| SERIAL | DATA NAME | LEVEL | TYPE | QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION |
|--------|-----------|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| | | 01 | REDEF | | RATE.TABLE |
| | RATE | 02 | | 30 | |
| | CITY | 03 | | | AAAAAAAAAAAAAA |
| | ONE.WAY | 03 | | | 999V99 |
| | ROUND.TRIP | 03 | | | 999V99 |
| | EXCURSION | 03 | | | 999V99 |

In the first of these entries, the data previously defined as RATE.TABLE is redefined (by the type code REDEF) as a new body of data. In this case a name has not been given to the redefined data, but the programmer could assign one if he wished. It will be noted that the level of the new entry (01) is the same as that of the entry being redefined.

The RATE entry and the four data-names which follow it (CITY, ONE.WAY, ROUND.TRIP, and EXCURSION) are on lower levels (02 and 03); therefore, they will be understood to be subordinate elements of the entry at the 01 level, and the code REDEF will apply to them as well.

The number 30 in the "Quantity" columns, as will be explained later in this chapter, shows that space is to be reserved for 30 entries at the 02 level. In other words, there will be 30 items called RATE. It will be seen later that the programmer may single out any one of these items by appending a subscript to the name RATE. This subscript may be a literal, a data-name, or a limited arithmetic expression. The value represented by the subscript must be a positive integer, since it will be used within the system to count individual items until the required one is reached. (See the discussion of lists, tables, and subscripts in Chapter 2.)

It has been noted that the name RATE includes all of the four items immediately following it. Thus, each of the 30 RATE entries will contain one called CITY, one called ONE.WAY, another called ROUND.TRIP, and a fourth called EXCURSION. Since 30 separate RATE entries were specified, the processor will lay out this entire sequence 30 times.

The characters in the "Description" columns show the length and type of data to be expected in each field. This is explained more fully later in this chapter, but the effect of the entries given in the example is as follows: The 14 A's following the name CITY will reserve space in storage for names of up to 14 characters in length. The symbols 999V99 will reserve space for five-digit numeric values, with an assumed decimal point between the third and fourth digits.

Once the processor has this information, it can identify and use any single item of data in the table. It will know, for example, that the first 14 character spaces of each RATE listing contain the name of a destination city, that the next five show the corresponding one-way rate, and so on. In other words, it now has the means of locating any item by its position in storage, which, as has been noted already, is the way in which the system locates all items of data in storage.

The programmer may then call for any individual item by its name, using a subscript to specify which one of the 30 items having the same name is wanted. Thus, ONE.WAY (17) would obtain the one-way rate for the 17th city in the table. Usually, however, the subscript would be a variable, such as the name of a field containing a number.

Suppose, for instance, that the input record contains a field called DESTINATION, and that this field will contain, at object time, a numeric code representing one of the cities listed in the table. If the programmer writes MOVE ONE.WAY (DESTINATION) TO BILL.AMOUNT, the system will obtain whatever number has been placed in the DESTINATION field and will use it to determine which item in the table is wanted. It will then find that item and move it to the field called BILL.AMOUNT. The reader will have noted that this number determines the position of data by the simple process of counting lines; the code numbers used, therefore, must be assigned in a sequence corresponding to the lines of the table.

#### COPY

This type code is used to copy a data description previously defined in the program so that it can be used again elsewhere. This makes it possible to use a data description with new data-names and, if desired, new level numbers.

The COPY type code is used as follows: The new name of the data description entry is written in the "Data Name" columns of the new entry. The code COPY is placed in the "Type" columns. The data description to be copied is specified by writing its original name in the "Description" columns. This description must already have been read into the system for the COPY code to be able to operate on it.

The processor will then obtain the original data description and copy it in its entirety, except for the following modifications: (1) The original name will be replaced by the new name. (2) If a new level number has been specified for the new name, the level numbers of the original data description will be adjusted so that they retain their original relationship to the named entry. Thus, if the original sequence of level numbers had been 01, 03, 04, and if the new name is assigned level 05, the other items would now be placed at levels 07 and 08, respectively.

Suppose the programmer had previously written the following entries in the data description:

| SERIAL | DATA NAME | LEVEL | TYPE |
|--------|-----------|-------|------|
| | PAY.RCD.MASTER | 01 | |
| | EMPLOYEE.NAME | 02 | |
| | JOB.TITLE | 02 | |
| | HOURLY.RATE | 02 | |
| | GROSS.PAY | 02 | |
| | TAXES | 02 | |
| | FICA | 03 | |
| | FED.INCOME | 03 | |
| | STATE.INCOME | 03 | |
| | NET.PAY | 02 | |

Suppose then that he wishes to set up an identical data description for a detail record, except that the new description is to have the name PAY.RCD.DETAIL and it will be placed at level 02. He could write the following entry:

| SERIAL | DATA NAME | LEVEL | TYPE | DESCRIPTION |
|--------|-----------|-------|------|-------------|
| | PAY.RCD.DETAIL | 02 | COPY | PAY.RCD.MASTER |

The effect of this entry would be as though the programmer had written an entirely new set of entries in the following form:

| SERIAL | DATA NAME | LEVEL | TYPE |
|--------|-----------|-------|------|
| | PAY.RCD.DETAIL | 02 | |
| | EMPLOYEE.NAME | 03 | |
| | JOB.TITLE | 03 | |
| | HOURLY.RATE | 03 | |
| | GROSS.PAY | 03 | |
| | TAXES | 03 | |
| | FICA | 04 | |
| | FED.INCOME | 04 | |
| | STATE.INCOME | 04 | |
| | NET.PAY | 03 | |

#### LABEL

The type code LABEL identifies a data description as that of a label record. This will cause a redefinition of the label area in the input-output control system. The actual use of this code will be explained in the publications pertaining to the various Commercial Translator processors as they apply to individual machine systems.

### Quantity (Col. 31-35)

If an item of data will be followed by one or more additional items having the same data description, the programmer can avoid writing the additional data descriptions simply by specifying in Columns 31 through 35 the total number of times the data description is required. This number must refer to data items occurring in sequence.

The "Quantity" columns may be left blank, and, in fact, usually are. In that case, it will be assumed that they contain a value of 1, and the specified data description will be entered only once.

Since quantity numbers are used to specify sequences of data descriptions for use in lists and tables, and since data in tables is referred to by the use of subscripted names, quantity numbers should not be assigned to data items not having names, unless these items include named items at a lower level.

An example of the use of a quantity entry was included in the discussion of the REDEF type code when used to set up a table. (See page 75.) The reader will recall that the field called RATE, together with its subordinate fields, was to be entered 30 times. Accordingly, the value 30 was placed in the "Quantity" columns opposite the name RATE. Since each of the subordinate items (CITY, ONE.WAY, ROUND.TRIP, and EXCURSION) was required only once for each RATE entry, no value was placed in the corresponding "Quantity" columns. If, for some reason, one of the subordinate fields had been needed more than once, a quantity could have been specified.

Quantity numbers may be specified for as many as three levels in a single "nested" group. For example, assume that a program must deal with five items called STATE, that within each of these are four fields named DISTRICT, and that each DISTRICT contains seven smaller fields called CITY. The quantity 5 should then be written for STATE, 4 for DISTRICT, and 7 for CITY. The processor will then reserve storage space for a total of 5 STATE items, 20 DISTRICT items, and 140 CITY items (assuming, of course, that the level numbers show the proper relationships among the three entries).

To call for any one item of data, the programmer must write as many subscripts as are necessary to identify the particular level. Thus, STATE (3) would call for the third item called STATE, DISTRICT (3,2) would call for the second DISTRICT field within the third STATE item, and CITY (3,2,6) would obtain the sixth CITY field in the second DISTRICT of the third STATE. Subscripts are always written in descending order of level.

### Mode (Col. 36)

The term "mode" refers to the method by which data is represented, such as the binary mode or the binary coded decimal mode. For the purposes of the Commercial Translator, the mode used in the arithmetic units of the system is considered to be the system's "internal" mode, although the system may be able to read data in other modes.

Column 36 is used to show whether the data being described is prepared in the internal mode for the system being used. In that case, the letter I is punched in this column. Data punched in an "external" mode is represented by the letter E. Specific information on the modes available for each system will be provided in the publications covering the processors for the various machine systems.

Since a body of data may contain information in more than one mode, the mode is specified at the lowest level of data organization—i.e., at the level where the "field pictorial" is shown. (See the "Description" columns.) Thus, if a record at the 01 level contains two fields at the 02 level, one of them in the internal mode and one in the external, there would be no point in specifying a mode for the record itself. The mode (or modes) of a larger unit is therefore a consequence of the mode specified for each of its components.

### Justify (Col. 37)

The term "justification" is used in printing and writing to mean the alignment of a margin. Thus, the text of this manual is both "left justified" and "right justified." In data processing, the term has a similar implication, since it is usually necessary to specify that data be justified if the programmer wishes it to be printed out with an aligned margin.

Actually, however, justification means a good deal more than this. Specifically, it refers to the placement of the data in a unit of storage. In many systems, data is stored in machine "words" of fixed length. Very often, therefore, a particular item of data will be shorter than the space allowed for it, and it may be necessary, if alignment is to be preserved, to provide a means of filling the unoccupied spaces with non-significant characters, such as zeros or blanks, depending on the system. On the other hand, it may be desirable to fill all available space with data, so that more than one item—or parts of more than one item—may be stored in a given machine word. This is known as "packing."

It is extremely important to recognize that justification specified for an *input* item of data—i.e., an item to be entered into the system at object time—describes the item as it already exists. It does not change the justification; it is used in informing the system where to look for the incoming data. Justification specified for other items, however, actually controls the placement of the data. It instructs the system how to handle the data when it operates on it internally or prepares it for output.

The effect of specifying justification is as follows: If left justification is specified, the data item is stored, or will be stored, so that its left-hand character is placed in the left-hand position of the next available machine word. This may mean that the right-hand portion of the preceding word is left unoccupied. If right justification is stipulated, the data item is stored, or will be stored, to the right in the next available machine word, leaving unoccupied whatever portion of that word is not required at the left. If no justification is specified, the data is packed (if it is incoming data) or will be packed—there will be no blank spaces between successive items.

Packing makes efficient use of storage space, but it may make it more difficult for the program to obtain the items independently of each other, since the processor may have to provide for "unpacking." However, packed items can usually be read or written more rapidly, since the system will not have to process non-significant information. In general, if the programmer must be economical of storage space, or if the program calls extensively for reading or writing long sequences of data, it may be more efficient to pack the data. If a great many of the items must be obtained individually, however, and/or if scanning long sequences of data is not a common operation, justification of data may be more efficient. The programmer should evaluate each case on its particular merits.

Alignment of alphameric information, such as lists of names, cannot be specified in the field pictorial. If alignment of such data is required, it can be accomplished by the use of the "Justify" column.

The symbols L and R are used in Column 37 to indicate left and right justification respectively. If neither symbol is used, the data will be packed, as has already been noted.

### Description (Col. 38-71)

The "Description" columns are used to show the length of each field of data, together with its format. They may also be used to specify constants and the names of data and procedures, as explained below. Specifically, the following kinds of information may appear in Columns 38 through 71:

1. Format characters. These are shown and described in the table below.
2. Constants.
3. Data names associated with the type codes REDEF and COPY.
4. The word LIBRARY, followed by the name of a data description stored in the library.
5. The words QUANTITY IN, followed by the name of a field which will contain a quantity when the object program is run.

In a number of cases, a complete data description entry will require that more than one of these kinds of information be listed on the same line. For example, it is generally necessary to show both the format and the value of a constant. In such a case, the various items should be written in the order shown above, separated by one or more blanks.

#### Format Characters

The format characters serve two functions: (1) They show the number of character spaces to be occupied by a field. (2) They show the kind of character that will occupy each space. The resulting data representation is known as a "field pictorial."

If the item of data being described is one which will be brought into the system at object time, the format characters must reflect the format of the data as it already exists; changes in input data cannot be effected by the field pictorial. However, if the item is one produced as a result of the operation of the program—as in moving the data or performing arithmetic on it, for example—the field pictorial has a direct effect on the manner in which the data will be handled.

With certain exceptions, which are explained below, one format character is required for each data character for which storage space is to be reserved. The particular format character chosen for each space prepares the system to receive in that space data of the type shown in the table on the following page.

| Format Character | Meaning and Use |
|------------------|-----------------|
| A | Any non-numeric character, including the blank. |
| X | Alphameric character (any character in the machine's character set). |
| 9 | Any numeric character. |
| 8 | Numeric character, to be replaced automatically by a blank whenever it is a non-significant zero. |
| * | Numeric character, to be replaced automatically by an asterisk whenever it is a non-significant zero. |
| V | Assumed decimal point. This character informs the processor where the decimal point is located, for purposes of calculation and/or alignment of values. The symbol is not required for integers. The symbol V will not reserve an actual space in storage. |
| . | True decimal point. This character will reserve an actual space in storage. |
| S | Scale factor. This symbol is used as a "filler" or "spacer" when the input data does not show the position of the decimal point. E.g., a field containing percentages from 1 to 9 would be represented by the notation VS9; this would assure that the values 1 to 9 would be interpreted as .01 to .09. Similarly, if a field contains values that represent thousands, each unspecified digit must be represented by an S; thus, the notation 999SSS would provide for values from 000,000 to 999,000, even though the three right-hand zeros would not appear as input. |
| $ | Dollar sign. An actual dollar sign will be placed in the indicated position, provided it is not followed by the symbol 8. In the latter case, the dollar sign will "float"—i.e., it will be placed immediately to the left of the first significant digit remaining. |
| , | True comma. This symbol will reserve an actual space in storage, to be occupied by the comma. The comma itself may be replaced by a blank, asterisk, or dollar sign, if the operation of a preceding 8 or * has resulted in the elimination of non-significant zeros to the left. |
| + | Plus or minus sign, one of which will always be placed in the space reserved for it, depending on whether the value is positive or negative. (Compare with use of minus sign, described below.) This sign may be placed in a column by itself, in which case it will reserve an actual space in storage. Alternatively, it may be entered as an "overpunch" with either of the format characters 8 or 9, in either the units or high-order position of a field; in this case, a special space will not be reserved, and the sign of the field will be indicated in accordance with the operating characteristics of the particular system. |
| - | Minus sign, to be placed in the space reserved for it when the value is negative; when the value is positive, the space will be left blank. If punched in a space by itself, this symbol will reserve a space in memory; otherwise, it may be "overpunched" and will act as described in the rules for the symbol +. |
| F | Floating point number. This symbol does not reserve an actual space in storage; it informs the processor that the number being described is a floating point number. It is placed between the format characters representing the fraction and those representing the exponent. E.g., +99V9F+99. |
| (n) | A number placed in parentheses immediately following one of the other format characters instructs the processor to allow for that number of the character specified. E.g., 9(4)A(12) is equivalent to 9999AAAAAAAAAAAA. |

##### Examples

The following examples indicate the range of characters for which provision is made by the notation shown:

| Notation | Range of Characters Provided For |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| AAA | All characters in the machine's character set except numerals. |
| 88999 | All numeric values from 000 to 99999. |
| \*\*\*\*.99 | All numeric values from \*\*\*\*.00 to 9999.99. |
| $888,888.99 | All numeric values from $.00 to $999,999.99. |

#### Constants

A constant is a value, or a group of symbols, placed in the program for use without alteration, such as a fixed percentage rate or a fixed name. A constant may be placed in the system by writing a data description entry for it which includes both a statement of its format (using the format characters) and a statement of the actual value or group of symbols. The format is specified by a standard field pictorial entry. The actual value, or the actual symbols, must then be written on the same line, separated from the field pictorial by at least one blank. This value (or this group of symbols) must be enclosed in quotation marks.

While a literal may be thought of as a form of a constant, the reader should note two distinctions: (1) Literals are written in procedure statements, whereas constants are placed in the system by means of data description entries. (2) Constants, unlike literals, must always be enclosed in quotation marks, even though they may be wholly numeric.

To illustrate, if the programmer wished to place the percentage .05 into the data description as a constant, it would be necessary to specify the nature of the constant by a notation such as the following:

| SERIAL | DATA NAME | DESCRIPTION |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| | PERCENT.CONST | V99 '05' |

In this example, the notation V99 is, of course, the field pictorial, and it is followed by a statement of the actual value of the constant.

#### Data Names Associated with REDEF and COPY

When the type codes REDEF and COPY are used, it is necessary to specify the name of the data item or area to be redefined or copied. This name must be entered in the "Description" columns. (See the discussion of those type codes earlier in this chapter.)

#### Library Names

The word LIBRARY, followed by the name of a data description stored in the library, designates a data description which is to be copied. Availability of this code enables the programmer to store data descriptions which are frequently required, so that he can save the effort of writing new ones when a previous one will serve his purpose. When a library data description is prescribed, the type code COPY must be used.

#### Quantities Specified in Named Fields

It has been shown that if a value is placed in the "Quantity" columns, the processor will reserve space for repeating the specified data description until it appears the number of times indicated by that value. In certain special cases, the programmer may wish to alter the use of such an area at the time the object program is run. The storage area, of course, will already have been reserved by the action of the processor, and at object time it is no longer possible to set aside new areas. However, for certain specialized purposes, it is possible to regroup the components of an existing area by using the QUANTITY IN option. In this case, a quantity value is placed in a named field and the program is referred to this field by the words QUANTITY IN followed by the name of the field.

This usage is not required in most programs. It represents an advanced programming technique, providing additional facilities which can be used effectively by a skilled programmer. While it is not the purpose of this manual to explain the many refinements and uses of this technique, its general nature is indicated by the following discussion:

Suppose that a certain data description having the field pictorial 999V99 is to be repeated until it appears 100 consecutive times. Each iteration of the data description will reserve 5 character spaces in storage, and therefore a total of 500 spaces will be reserved altogether. Suppose that this area is referred to by the name TABLE.

Suppose, then, that the programmer wishes to set up a number of different tables at different times during the running of the object program, using this same storage area for each. Assume that the first, referred to in this text as Table 1, consists of 10 columns and 10 lines—i.e., there will be 10 data items on each of 10 lines, and each item will have a field pictorial of 999V99. This table could have been set up by the original data description for the area in a series of entries such as the following:

| SERIAL | DATA NAME | LEVEL | QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION |
|--------|-----------|-------|----------|-------------|
| | TABLE | 01 | | |
| | COLUMN | 02 | 10 | |
| | ITEM | 03 | 10 | |

Once the table is described, the programmer may refer to individual items in it by the use of subscripts, the first subscript referring to the item at the higher level. Thus, ITEM (4, 2) would refer to the second item of the fourth COLUMN group.

When the system is directed to obtain this item, it relies on a technique of counting. Specifically, it would rely on the fact that ten items are specified for each column. Thus, it would count off the first ten items, then the ten items of the second column, the ten items of the third column, and it would then count to the second item following. In other words, it would obtain the 32nd item in the string of data representing the table.

However, it is supposed that at some other time in the program the programmer wishes to set up another table (Table 2) which uses the same field pictorial for each item but which requires a different grouping of columns and lines. Suppose Table 2 has 20 columns and 5 lines. The programmer could theoretically write the following entries:

| SERIAL | DATA NAME | LEVEL | QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION |
|--------|-----------|-------|----------|-------------|
| | TABLE | 01 | | |
| | COLUMN | 02 | 20 | |
| | ITEM | 03 | 5 | |

However, these entries would reserve space in addition to, not in place of, the original table.

Suppose, however, that the programmer, in setting up Table 1, had written the following entries:

| SERIAL | DATA NAME | LEVEL | QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION |
|--------|-----------|-------|----------|-------------|
| | TABLE | 01 | | |
| | COLUMN | 02 | | QUANTITY IN COLUMN.QTY |
| | ITEM | 03 | 100 | QUANTITY IN ITEM.QTY |

Suppose, further, that the names COLUMN.QTY and ITEM.QTY are the names of fields into which values may be placed. In this case, the processor would first note the value of 100 in the "Quantity" column opposite the name ITEM and would reserve space for a total of 100 items to be placed in the table. It would cause the object program to look in the fields COLUMN.QTY and ITEM.QTY to determine the actual quantities for the entries COLUMN and ITEM. These values would override any values previously placed in the "Quantity" columns. If the programmer wished the first table to have 10 columns of 10 items each, he would have to be sure that a value of 10 was placed in both the COLUMN.QTY and ITEM.QTY fields. Obviously, if Table 1 were never to be replaced by another table, it would be superfluous to use QUANTITY IN entries, for the quantities could be specified directly in the data description.

However, since the QUANTITY IN entries have been made, it is now an easy matter to construct Table 2. All that is necessary is to place the values 20 and 5 in COLUMN.QTY and ITEM.QTY respectively. If, then, the expression ITEM (4,2) is written, the system will know that instead of counting ten items to the column it must count five. Thus, instead of obtaining the 32nd item, it will obtain the 17th, which is the one required.

If the programmer wished to set up a third table in the same area, with four columns and 25 lines, he could place the values 04 and 25 in the corresponding fields, and, once again, subscripts written in accordance with the new table structure would be correctly calculated by the system for locating individual data items.

*General Note:* If the description of a data item overflows from the "Description" columns, it may be continued on the next line, following the rules given for the continuation indication column (Column 72). The break at the end of a line must occur between words, since the processor will assume a blank at the end of each line. Multiple blanks, however, are treated as single blanks. If a constant is to be carried over onto a new line, the portion on each line must be treated as a complete constant (i.e., enclosed in quotation marks); the continuation indication is not used in this case, and no blanks will be assumed between successive lines. (Note the example used on page 74 to show how a table of rates might be placed in storage.)

### Cont. (Col. 72)

If the description to be entered in either the "Data Name" or "Description" columns (Columns 7 through 22 or Columns 38 through 71) is too large for the space allowed, it may be continued on a following line. So that the processor will recognize this situation, the programmer must enter a character of some sort in Column 72. Any non-blank character will suffice. The processor will then interpret the entry in the succeeding card as a consecutive part of the previous entry.

A continued name must, of course, be placed in the "Data Name" columns, and an overflowing description must be continued in the "Description" columns. The rules for determining where the text should break between lines are given in the discussions of the entries to be made in those columns.

### Identification (Col. 73-80)

Columns 73 through 80 are provided for the optional use of the programmer should he wish to place a code on the cards to identify the program of which they are a part. Any characters from the basic character set may be used, since the characters in these columns have no effect on either the processor or the object program.

## Storage Areas

It has been pointed out that the internal storage of an electronic data processing system may be used to contain data of various kinds, including the program which governs the processing. As a result, those who work regularly with the technical aspects of programming are accustomed to thinking of different kinds of storage.

For example, when an input record is brought into storage, space must be reserved for the original record before any processing is carried out. This may be thought of as an input area.

Then, after processing begins, it is often necessary to move data from the input area into an area where it can be worked on. This is like moving a ledger card from a file to a writing desk where an entry will be made or a value computed. "Working storage" is therefore required in many cases. Actually, the registers of the system provide space of this kind in many operations, and since in these cases it is provided automatically, it is not thought of as working storage. However, in other cases, it may be necessary to reserve a specific amount of space as working storage. For example, a computation will sometimes produce intermediate results which will be needed later in the program but which are never needed as such in the output record. It may therefore be necessary to reserve an area in which to store such results temporarily.

Another necessary use of storage space is for the assembling of output records. Normally, as each phase of a program is completed, the results will be moved to an output area until the complete record has been assembled. The various output fields may differ in format, size, and sequence from those of the input record, and data may have been added or deleted. Thus, an area of storage must usually be set aside for assembling the output record.

Other storage areas may be used for reference data, such as constants, literals, and tables.

The experienced programmer often finds it convenient to distinguish among these various kinds of storage. Actually, of course, all storage areas are controlled by the same basic techniques—data is always addressed by its location, and data in any area may be governed by any of the system's basic operating instructions. Since the Commercial Translator system eliminates the need for the programmer to keep track of specific storage areas, it also eliminates, for the most part, the need to distinguish between types of storage areas. Storage areas are automatically reserved when the data description is written, regardless of how the area is to be used. Certain special provisions, especially those governing input and output, are built into the processor for each system, and these are described in the manuals for the various processors.

The programmer, however, must be sure that all data-names required for input and output, as specified in the manual for the system he is using, are properly described in the data description. He should also examine his program to be sure that every item of data used in the program, whether as input, output, or for intermediate operations, is properly described. The processor will then make all necessary provisions for storage space and for identifying the data to be stored.
